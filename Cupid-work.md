The Cupid algorithm operates in several steps:

1. Attribute Profile Generation: Cupid analyzes the characteristics of each attribute in the schemas to create attribute profiles. This involves collecting statistical information such as attribute names, data types, value distributions, and format patterns.

2. Profile Comparison: Cupid compares the attribute profiles of different schemas to identify potentially matching attributes. It utilizes various similarity measures to determine the degree of similarity between attribute profiles.

3. Attribute Clustering: Based on the similarity measures, Cupid groups the potentially matching attributes into clusters. Each cluster represents a set of attributes that are likely to correspond to each other.

4. Correspondence Determination: Within each attribute cluster, Cupid applies additional techniques (e.g., machine learning, rule-based matching) to determine the correspondences or matches between attributes. This step involves considering various factors such as attribute names, data types, and the information gathered from the profile comparison. Using match tree.

5. Match Confirmation and Output: The final step involves validating the determined attribute correspondences and producing the output, which typically includes a mapping or alignment between the attributes of the different schemas.

6. The Cupid algorithm is commonly used in data integration and schema matching scenarios, where it helps automate the process of identifying and establishing relationships between attributes across disparate database schemas.
